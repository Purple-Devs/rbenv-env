This [rbenv](http://rbenv.org/) plugin adds the `rbenv env` command that shows relevant environment variables.

## Usage

Run the command

    $ rbenv env

To see what environment variables rbenv / plugins pass to commands (Shows PATH and any variables that start with GEM, RAILS, RBENV or RUBY)

## Installation

To install rbenv-env, clone this repository into your ~/.rbenv/plugins directory. (You'll need a recent version of rbenv that supports plugin bundles.)

    $ mkdir -p ~/.rbenv/plugins
    $ cd ~/.rbenv/plugins
    $ git clone https://github.com/ianheggie/rbenv-env.git
